    In order to code, you will need of course, the language itself.  First, let us get our programming languages installed and set up in our systems. To install and get started with python, simply follow the steps here -  \n

    Now, we will need an **[Integrated development environment  (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)** for writing and executing our codes
    There are numerous options available. Few of the commonly used are -
    * [Visual Studio Code ](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    * [Atom Code Editor ] (https://atom.io/)
    * [PyCharm] (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
    * [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) - recommended for coding in R but also supports python üòâ
    * [Jupyter Notebook] (https://jupyter.org/)
